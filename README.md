# 🪞 MirrorMind – A Portal Into Your Emotions

> _"Not all mirrors reflect your face. Some reflect your soul."_

MirrorMind is a creative, emotion-reactive web experience that turns your thoughts into visuals, sound, and art. Speak or type your inner feelings — and watch as a digital canvas comes alive with your mood. 

Whether you're joyful, angry, calm, or lost in a storm of thoughts, MirrorMind transforms those emotions into ambient visuals and soundscapes — a reflection not of your face, but your state of mind.

## 🌌 Inspiration

Born from the intersection of emotion, art, and technology, it aims to:
- Promote mindfulness
- Encourage emotional expression
- Blend the inner world with the outer digital landscape

> _Art isn’t always made with a brush. Sometimes, it’s made with your breath._

🧭 Project Vision

MirrorMind was designed to create a bridge between **emotional self-awareness** and **interactive technology**. We believe that art and introspection shouldn’t be confined to the physical world. By turning your inner thoughts into responsive digital art, we hope to:

- 🪞 Make emotion visible
- 🌌 Encourage reflection and expression
- 🧠 Use tech for wellness and self-exploration

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced

- 🎙️ **Speech Recognition Noise** – Accurately capturing spoken emotion was tricky in testing environments.
- 🧠 **Emotion Mapping** – Translating vague, human inputs into clear emotional categories without sounding robotic.
- 🎨 **Visual Tuning** – Ensuring each emotion had distinct yet appealing visuals.
- 🌍 **Browser Compatibility** – Making Web Speech API and audio work seamlessly across devices.
- 🔐 **Privacy by Design** – Deciding to keep it fully client-side for user trust unless OpenAI is integrated with consent.

Each challenge helped refine MirrorMind into a polished and accessible experience.
